          The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men,
          old with the movement of the train, their high
          heels like polished hooves against the gray metal
          of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
          cassette replicating a dead manâ€™s skills, obsessions,
          kneejerk responses.
