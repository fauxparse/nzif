    <b>Important:</b> If payment is not received by 1 October, we reserve the right to
    cancel your registration and offer your workshop places to someone else.
    We really don’t want to do this, so if you need extra time to make your payment, please email us at
    <a href="mailto:registrations@improvfest.nz">registrations@improvfest.nz</a> — we’re happy to talk!

  If we manage to slot you into a workshop from a waitlist, we’ll notify you by email and/or text message.
  The cost of the workshop will be added to your registration fee, and you can pay the difference by
  visiting your registration page. Please pay this as soon as possible. For more information about
  waitlists, please see our <a href="https://my.improvfest.nz/about/faq">FAQ</a>.
